- 👋 Hi, I’m @LivinInLeeseyLand
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly in keeping up on all the updates and whatnot surrounding termux and it's music downloading package tidal-dl! Gotta keep building up that music inventory! But also, for years now, have had major personal interest in learning whatever I can in regards toknline and offline computer and mobile security measures in every way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. I recently partially decided I might go back to college to get a degree in cyber security, and I need to take my knowledge of that from barely enough to possibly spot issues needing addressed, to being able to read and write whatever coding languages and command lines and everything else I'll need to get a good start toward mastering the field 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I can't answer this one, really... I mostly use GitHub to keep tabs on termuxes tidal-dl downloader updates and fixes of issues that crop up, lol, so I dunno, looking to collab on getting help when needed and understanding how to execute the help that's shown and given when gotten? Lmao!
- 📫 How to reach me ... Iuno 🤷‍♀️🤣 here
